# 🌐 OpenDocs by Novincode

Welcome to **OpenDocs** — an open-source initiative to create the most accessible, modern, and community-driven documentation platform for learning programming languages.

**👉 [learn.codeideal.com](https://learn.codeideal.com)**

> Imagine W3Schools, but modern, open source, and built with care. That’s the goal.

## ✨ What's the Idea?

We’re building a new home for learning code — one that feels fresh, fast, and developer-friendly.

- 🔥 **Beautiful, expandable MDX-based docs**  
- 🧩 **Shadcn UI components** & custom rich code blocks  
- 💡 **GitHub-flavored Markdown support**  
- 🚀 **Hosted on Vercel, built with DX in mind**  
- 🤝 **Community-first: every contributor gets credited**

We're starting with the **"boring" languages** — the ones with outdated or overwhelming docs. The plan is to make learning them smooth and delightful.
